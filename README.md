NoSQL Coding
I received tutoring help from Carlos, therefore some code may have been added (Under question 3 for part 3: analysis section)
When connecting to the mongoDB database and converting latitude and longitude from strings into decimals, the main problem I am having is converting them from strings to Decimal128 in MongoDB, which is preventing the data from loading and querying correctly. Therefore, the results and dataframe for question 3 are unable to load since the conversions were not successful for those variables.
